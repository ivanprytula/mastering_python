"""
The structure of a Pygame program looks like this:
initialize_pygame()

while True:
    handle_input()
    process_game_logic()
    draw_game_elements()

`while` loop starts the game loop. Each iteration of this loop generates a single
frame of the game and usually performs the following operations:

1. Input handling: Input like pressed buttons, mouse motion, and VR controllers
position is gathered and then handled. Depending on the game, it can cause objects to
change their position, create new objects, request the end of the game, and so on.

2. Game logic: This is where most of the game mechanics are implemented. Here,
the rules of physics are applied, collisions are detected and handled, artificial
intelligence does its job, and so on. This part is also responsible for checking if
the player has won or lost the game.

3. Drawing: If the game hasnâ€™t ended yet, then this is where the frame will be drawn
on screen. It will include all the items that are currently in the game and are
visible to the player.
